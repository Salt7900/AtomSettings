Which object plays the role of self depends on the context\n    answer: self\n-\n    question: Called from a method, searches along the method lookup path (the classes and modules available to the current object) for the next method of the same name as the one being executed. Such method, if present, may be defined in the superclass of the object''s class, but may also be defined in the superclass''s superclass or any class on the upward path, as well as any module mixed in to any of those classes\n    answer: super\n-\n    question: Optional component of conditional statements (if, unless, when). Never mandatory, but allows for one-line conditionals without semi-colons\n    answer: then\n-\n    question: The sole instance of the special class TrueClass. true encapsulates Boolean truth; however- <emph>all</emph> objects in Ruby are true in the Boolean sense (informally- they cause an if test to succeed)- with the exceptions of false and nil\n    answer: true\n-\n    question: Undefines a given method, for the class or module in which it''s called. If the method is defined higher up in the lookup path (such as by a superclass), it can still be called by instances classes higher up\n    answer: undef\n-\n    question: The negative equivalent of if. i.e. unless y.score > 10 puts Sorry; you needed 10 points to win. end\n    answer: unless\n-\n    question: The inverse of while executes code until a given condition is true, i.e., while it is not true.
